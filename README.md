## About Sparkle

[Sparkle](https://github.com/SparkleCommons) is a project for providing a wide range of common functionality for Java 
projects so the same code doesn't have to be rewritten for every project. Sparkle was created by 
[qrokodial](https://github.com/qrokodial) for his own personal use, but anybody is free to use the Sparkle projects to 
do anything they want as long as they adhere to the licence. If you happen to use the Sparkle project in anything that 
you release, do me a favor and shoot me an email at qr$ok@pr$ojectbnet.n$et so I can hear more about what interesting 
things this project is being used in! (remove the '$' characters from the email address, those are just to obfuscate it 
from any spambots that might be crawling this page).

## Maven

As it currently stands, Sparkle Plugins is not on an official Maven repository. In order to use this, you must first 
clone this repository.

## Dependencies

This project depends on another Sparkle project, [Sparkle Utilities](https://github.com/SparkleCommons/Utilities), 
which you will need to clone and build locally in order for the Maven dependency to be met.

## Licence

As with all components in the Sparkle project, Plugins and its only dependency, Utilities, are both licenced under MIT.
